  "description": "Before he was Benjamin Franklin, inventor and statesman, he was just Ben, a boy in Colonial Boston with an adventurous spirit, a curious mind...and a penchant for getting into trouble. Meet our most endearing founding father at fourteen; a charming rebel years away from discovering the ageless sayings and brilliant inventions that made him famous. When Ben and his friends stumble upon a mysterious letter leading to a legendary treasure, he'll have to use his wits and bravery to outsmart the cruel British governor of Massachusetts.
